# Given a named module <module_name>, we ca:
#     - define <module_name>_load() and <module_name>_init(): the module exports some callable function
#       and also executes initialization code.
#     - define <module_name>_load() only: exports some callable function without the need for initialization.
#     - define <module_name>_init() only: the module is used to export global variables or initialization chore only.

# Loading function:
#     - must be named <module_name>_load().
#     - it is only called once at load time, it can be used only to load 
#       other modules as dependencies and to load final functions.
